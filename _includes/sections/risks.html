      <h3>Physical theft</h3>

      <h3>Counterfeiting</h3>
      Counterfeiting involves creating imitation currency. It is estimated that 1 in 10,000 notes are counterfeit.

      <h3>Identity theft</h3>
      Identity theft happens when thieves use sensitive personally identifiable information of their victims (such as name, address, phone numbers and social security numbers) to open credit cards or access and drain current bank accounts.

      <h3>Ponzi schemes</h3>
      Also known as pyramid schemes, these investments pay old investors returns with the money from new investors, rather than from actual profit. The largest Ponzi scheme ever executed was the Bernie Madoff scandal of 2008, with investors losing $40 billion in the 30 year-long fraud.

      <h3>Internet fraud</h3>
      Hackers running fake websites ask users for private information that allows them to access their bank accounts (called phishing).

      <h3>Fraudulent company accounting</h3>
      Dishonest companies change the numbers in their bookkeeping or set up shell companies (companies with no product, value, or profit) to filter money to falsely alter company profits. An example of this fraud is the Enron scandal of 2001.

      <h3>Investor fraud</h3>
      Stock market brokers use several illegal techniques to time the market to their benefit. Front running is buying personal shares of a stock right before a large client purchase that positively affects the market price, then selling their personal shares for a profit immediately after. Insider trading is using company information that is not accessible to all investors to buy or sell on the stock market at an opportune moment.

      <h3>Physical theft</h3>

      <h3>Counterfeiting</h3>
      Gold coins and bars and sold as solid gold could be a less valuable metal that is gold plated. These metals often weigh the same as gold and dupe those that do not get the proper metallurgic tests.

      <h3>Cash for gold</h3>
      Because gold does not have a global ledger authenticating ownership, stolen property can be processed through these companies.

      <h3>High Yield Investment Programs (HYIPs)</h3>
      An investment guaranteeing large returns on the gold market, these are often times Ponzi schemes.

      <h3>Shares in fraudulent mining companies</h3>
      These companies either do not hold the large gold reserve that they advertise or do not have the potential for finding new gold. An example of this was the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bre-x-6-billion-gold-fraud-indonesia-2014-10">1997 Bre-X scandal</a>.

      <h3>Digital theft</h3>
      Taking control of a coin's private key allows a thief to spend or transfer bitcoins that are not theirs.

      <h3>Ponzi schemes</h3>
      Where there is market volatility and opportunity for investment, there is an environment for pyramid fraud. This is no different for bitcoin. A recent example involved a scheme where a man bought bitcoins for investors, returning 7% weekly interest. In reality he paid older investor's returns with new investor's money.

      <h3>Hacking coins</h3>
      Thieves stole 850,000 bitcoins through security glitches in the Mt. Gox exchange collapse in 2014. 200,000 coins have been recovered since.

      <h3>Hacking CPU power</h3>
      Because mining bitcoins requires a great deal of computing power and electricity, hackers have found a way to access cloud accounts (like Amazon Web Services) to use the servers for mining, running up hundreds of thousands of dollars of charges.
