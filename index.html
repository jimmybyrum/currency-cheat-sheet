          Working on <a href="https://coinledger.io">Coin Ledger</a> has made us realize that money is vast and confusing. And that most things written about money assume everyone has majored in economics. Or has their Econ101 notes handy at all times to look up what a "security" is, why the news always mentions the Federal Reserve and why some people are interested in the gold standard.

          And then there's Bitcoin with its own set of tech jargon– with words like "decentralized", "nodes" and "cryptocurrency" it's pretty easy to see why people think it is something only for nerds or gamblers.

          So we set out to figure out Bitcoin's place by comparing it to two other oft-spoken about currencies: the US Dollar and Gold.

          Here is the resulting cheat sheet.

          <strong>Fiat Currency</strong>
          This is a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money#Definition">money created by a government</a> whose value comes from declaration– fiat means "let it be done" in Latin. The currency is regulated by the government to ensure stability.

          <strong>Since 1785</strong>
          The original US financial system was constructed almost single-handedly by Alexander Hamilton and had bills called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_American_currency#Continental_currency">Continentals</a>. Continentals suffered a severe reduction in value during the Revolutionary War due to over printing.

          Congress issued the replacement currency, the dollar, on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_dollar#Background">August 8, 1785</a>. To ensure faith in its value, this new currency was backed by silver and gold- meaning that each dollar matched an existing quantity of either metal.

          This worked until there was a global devaluation of silver. In 1900 Congress passed the Gold Standard Act which tied the dollar only to gold.

          During World War I, US companies held debts to European companies and made payments with gold. This large liquidation disrupted the dollar exchange rate and led to the country temporarily suspending the gold standard.

          In 1971 the gold standard was <a href="http://www.federalreservehistory.org/Events/DetailView/33">permanently removed</a>.

          <strong>Since The Bronze Age</strong>
          The Bronze Age (3300-1200BC) marks man's first use of bronze and other metals <a href="http://www.ancient.eu/gold/">including gold</a>. Gold's beauty made it a valuable metal used in trading.

          Gold coins were first used in Persia in the <a href="http://taxfreegold.co.uk/goldcoinsbriefhistory.html">7th century B.C.</a>

          While today gold no longer backs any national currency, it remains a commodity traded on the market with a <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?From=XAU&To=USD">shifting price</a> due to market fluctuations. It tends to perform well <a href="http://www.moneycrashers.com/buying-gold-good-investment/">when confidence in a fiat currency drops</a>.

          <strong>Since 2008</strong>
          Digital currencies have been tried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_currencies#Non-cryptocurrencies">a few times</a> since the spread of the internet in the 1990s. Digicash, founded in 1989, eventually <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-215150.html">failed due to market forces favoring credit cards</a>.

          Bitcoin was invented in the wake of the 2008 US financial crisis by a person or group under the pseudonym <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>. It was introduced as open source software in 2009 and was the first fully implemented cryptocurrency. It's decentralized nature make it possible to conduct financial transactions with no middleman, and no banks (which, at the time, were being <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/">bailed out by the Government</a>).

          Since early 2013, transaction volume in Bitcoin has been <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/charts">steadily growing</a>, with mainstream businesses and websites (including <a href="http://www.overstock.com/bitcoin">Overstock.com</a>, <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/expedia-exec-bitcoin-payments-have-exceeded-estimates/"≥Expedia</a>, <a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/campaigns/bitcoin-marketing">Dell</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/17/okcupid-bitcoin/">OKCupid</a>) accepting it as payment.

          <strong>Miners</strong>
          Bitcoin miners run the Bitcoin software, which attempts to <a href="http://www.bitcoinmining.com/">solve cryptographic math problems while confirming transactions</a> on the network. Each time a miner is the first to solve a cryptography problem for a set of transactions, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#term-coinbase-tx">they are rewarded with new Bitcoins</a>.

          The math problems being solved by miners help verify and authenticate all users' Bitcoin transactions, which secures the network (avoiding the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending">Double Spend</a> and <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/oldSiteFiles/byzantine.html">Byzantine Generals'</a> problems) and keeps the system in sync. This eradicates the need for one company or governing body to oversee the system, it is spread across many people. Changes to the system have to be approved by the majority of users before they are implemented.

          <strong>The Federal Reserve</strong>
          The Fed was <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12594.htm">created</a> in 1913 to ensure the strength and stability of the dollar, to serve as the central bank of the US, to regulate banking institutions and to manage the nation's money supply.

          It is comprised of a <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/directors/about.htm">board of directors</a> chosen by private banks and a <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12591.htm">board of governors</a> selected by the US president, all of whom work together to make policy decisions. The current chairman is Janet Yellen.

          <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/10-things-that-every-american-should-know-about-the-federal-reserve-2012-2">Critics see a conflict of interest in the system</a> which allows private banks to influence their own regulation, and point to the 2008 financial crisis, corporate bank bailouts and a continued policy of secrecy as concerns.

          <strong>The SEC (Securities And Exchange Commission) And The CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)</strong>
          Financial markets have regulatory oversight from these two agencies which work to ensure proper information is given to investors and traders so they can make sound decisions and also work to prevent fraud.

          The SEC was created in 1934 and the CFTC in 1974. They are both comprised of a non-partisan group of 5 commissioners, with one selected by the president as chairman. The current SEC chairman is Mary Jo White and the current CFTC chairman is Timothy Massad.

          Neither the SEC or CFTC has complete authority over gold's markets as most brokerage firms are monitored by self-regulatory organizations that they join. Exchanges also have their own regulatory groups.

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <strong>The Bitcoin Software, The US GAO (Government Accountability Office) And The CFTC</strong>
          The Bitcoin software <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply">regulates the frequency in which new Bitcoins are created</a>. This eradicates the need for one company or governing body to oversee the system. Changes to the system have to be approved by the majority of users before they are implemented.

          No one body runs or regulates Bitcoin within its own system. However as a result of its increased use, the US government is examining ways to prevent misuse and fraud.

          The GAO is an independent agency that was created in 1921. It is referred to as <a href="http://www.gao.gov/about/">"The Congressional Watchdog"</a> for its reports uncovering waste and inefficiency in government. It conducts financial audits and other investigative services.

          In 2013 the GAO <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/654620.pdf">called for increased oversight</a> for Bitcoin and recommended the IRS create tax guidance around virtual currencies. The result was the IRS declaring it to be <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Virtual-Currency-Guidance">treated as property</a>. Other regulations are still being formed.

          In July 2014 the European Banking Authority <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/eba-financial-institutions-avoid-bitcoin-pending-regulation/">advised European banks not to deal in virtual currencies</a> until a regulatory regime was in place.

          In April 2014 China Central Bank ordered commercial banks to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304157204579475233879506454">close Bitcoin trading accounts</a>.

          <strong>Federal Reserve Banks Put Up Their Assets</strong>
          <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed01.html">Federal Reserve banks puts up their assets for collateral</a> from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (US Treasury Dept) which include debts from the government and other banks and its own assets from open market investments. Fed Banks also pay for the cost of printing bills (about 4¢ per note) and the cost of minting coins (face value of the coin).

          Notes in poor condition are collected and shredded (about 7,000 tons per year). 90% of the notes delivered are used to replace older notes. $470 billion notes are created per year, 14-20 billion coins.

          <strong>Then Commercial Banks Get It From A Federal Reserve Bank In Their District</strong>
          The banks pay the value of the money by drawing down their reserve accounts with their district Fed Bank.

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <strong>Placer Mining</strong>
          Placer mining is used where gold has accumulated in the earth in ancient stream beds. Miners can find the ore by hand by panning or by machine by sluicing and dredging. The gold is then extracted through gravity separation.

          <strong>Extracted From Ore</strong>
          Hard rock mining is used when gold is encased in rock. This is the method that produces the most gold and is done through open-pit mining (digging the earth in sections to form a large pit). The gold is extracted from the rocks through a chemical reaction with cyanide, a toxic compound. Earth is cut and crushed into a flour-like powder then chemically treated with cyanide which separates the metal from the remaining rock flour. Zinc is then added to separate the cyanide from remaining gold. Then the result is melted to further remove impurities.

          To achieve 99.5% purity or higher, the gold has further chemical and electrolytic processing.

          Gold is also recycled- all the gold mined throughout history is still in existence. A new gold ring might contain some gold that was mined by ancient Romans 2000 years ago.

          Gold used in technology is in such small quantities that it does not get recycled. About 12% of the world's current gold production goes towards technology. About 50¢ of gold is used within each cell phone, totaling $500 million worldwide.

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <strong>Awarded Through Solving Math Problems</strong>
          Computers running algorithm solving software compete to find solutions to cryptographic problems (called creating a block) and are rewarded with Bitcoins. These blocks form the “blockchain” which is the linear, permanent irreversible ledger that Bitcoin is based off of and all participants are synced to. All transactions are publicly recorded and visible at blockchain.info.

          The system allows for a finite amount of coins will be found per year, up to 21 million in the year 2140.

          Countries who have unstable financial systems hold large quantities of US dollars for use in international transactions and to back their own financial system in the event of a crisis.

          The US dollar is the most used reserve currency. Others include the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen.

          <strong>Investment Vehicle, Reserve, And Possible Currency Backing.</strong>
          Gold is traded on the commodity market and is used as an investment.

          It can also be used as a currency backing. A gold standard is a system where money is tied to a specific amount of gold and could be exchanged for it. No country currently follows the gold standard but it has appeal to libertarians concerned with government regulation of fiat currency.

          <strong>The Cost To Mine Is $597.23 Per Coin (june 2014)</strong>
          Cost includes price of equipment and electricity to keep the equipment running. Miners are attracted to places where electricity is less expensive.

          Like gold, when the market price drops, miners will hold onto the Bitcoins they procure so that it eventually causes the price to increase again.

          A higher price draws more people to mine, which increases the difficulty of solving the math problems, which leads to upgrades in equipment and higher expenses for the miners.

          <strong>The Lbma (london Bullion Market Association)</strong>
          One of the costs associated with owning gold is verifying its authenticity through assaying (purity testing). One way to get around this fee is to obtain it from a system that has already verified its chain of custody.

          Physical gold that is bought and traded within the London Bullion Market is verified by its association the LBMA. The LBMA verifies the gold from refiner to dealer to owner and stores gold in approved vaults. Gold stored at home or outside the chain must be re-assayed before it is let back into the system.

          This verification system allows for expedited transactions.

          <strong>The Blockchain</strong>
          The core innovation of Bitcoin is the blockchain verification log, which records all transactions in its system publicly, permanently and irreversibly. Within it you can find every transaction that has ever been completed with the currency.

          The blockchain is a collaborative log contributed to by independent users (called miners) who have downloaded the Bitcoin software and use it to solve the math problems that encrypt transactions. Successful solving of transactions rewards the miners with new Bitcoins. Because the computational power needed to secure the system is aggregated from independent miners, there is no need for the infrastructure of a single company or other body to maintain it. This is why Bitcoin is described as a ‘decentralized' currency.

          This infrastructure prevents fraud as many independent verifications are needed to approve transactions.

          - commissions on buying selling

          <strong>Commission Fees</strong>
          Paid in USD or other fiat currency, commission fees are paid to exchanges when converting fiat money to Bitcoin. Coinbase charges 1% of the transaction.

          <strong>Bank Fees</strong>
          Paid in USD or other fiat currency, bank fees are paid to the bank transferring dollars to the Bitcoin exchange. The fee is on average $0.15.

          <strong>Miner Fees</strong>
          Miner fees are optional but are an incentive to speed up the transaction verification process (inclusion into the blockchain). People opting out of paying a miner fee will see their transaction clearing in a significantly longer time (in our test it took 12 hours with no fee vs 10 minutes with fee). Fees are based on the amount of bytes required by the transaction. More bytes equal more processing time for the miners. Fees are calculated accordingly:
          - 0.0001 Bitcoins (4¢) for first kilobyte
          - 0.0002 Bitcoins (7¢) after first kilobyte

          The fees are related to the technical transaction size, not the monetary size. The more the system must work to patch together parts of original bitcoins to create the total, the higher the bytes. A $250 transaction could have a lower fee than a $19.95 transaction.

          <strong>Fees Are Paid By The Spender, Not The Vendor</strong>
          Unlike in Paypal or credit card processing, the person buying pays the fees on the transaction. This makes it an attractive option for vendors.

          We randomly picked a transaction ( link in spreadsheet ) from blockchain.info totaling 0.34522894 Bitcoin ($123.19). The miner fee paid by the person buying was .0001 Bitcoin (4¢). The same transaction made through Paypal would cost the vendor $4.46.

          Another transaction ( link in spreadsheet )shows the same miner fee .0001 Bitcoin (4¢) on a 37.9362385 Bitcoin purchase ($13,543.62). Made through Paypal that same transaction would cost the vendor $474.18.

          While the vendors do not pay a fee per transaction, they will pay a commission fee when they exchange their earned Bitcoins for dollars (1%).

          <strong>1. Bank Savings Account</strong>
          a savings account with a bank allows a customer to save money with interest returned. The interest is typically very low- under 1% but the money is insured (guaranteed) and is available for immediate withdrawal

          <strong>2. Cds (certificate Of Deposit)</strong>
          similar to a savings account, a CD is insured and has a fixed interest rate slightly higher than a savings account. They differ in that the money must stay in the account for a fixed amount of time

          <strong>3. Money Market Accounts</strong>
          similar to a savings account, but allows for the ability to withdraw from the account provided a minimum balance is met

          <strong>4. Stock Market</strong>
          a place to buy and sell ownership shares of companies. Over the long run and across the entire market, return rates are typically up to 10% but are not guaranteed.

          <strong>5. Mutual Fund</strong>
          a professionally managed product that allows investment in a collection of stocks. Investors can take their money out of the mutual fund without needing to do it through an exchange.

          <strong>6. Index Fund</strong>
          an investment product that combines a similar group of stocks into one fund that is managed by a computer rather than by a person. The index model uses statistics to decide which stocks are included and are partitioned to a section of the market.

          <strong>7. Etfs (exchange Traded Funds)</strong>
          traded on stock exchanges, ETFs are comprised of a collection of stocks, commodities or bonds that act similar to an index fund but require less selling of its components and therefore have lower fees.

          <strong>8. Hedge Funds</strong>
          funds that are not available publicly that use risky short term investment methods to maximize profit for their investors. They are typically only used by high net worth individuals and are structured to avoid government regulation.

          People tend to invest in gold more during periods of economic weakness. Its day-to-day price volatility make it appealing to those wanting to profit off of its fluctuations.

          <strong>1. Bullion</strong>
          bulk gold in the form of bars and coins. The word comes from the French word for ‘boiling' (bouillon) which was the term for historic melting houses.

          <strong>2. Coins</strong>
          similar to bullion bars, gold coins are a store of value and not meant for use as currency. Their small size makes them easier to store and distribute.

          <strong>3. Gold Etfs</strong>
          these funds are traded on the stock market like stock ETFs and allow an investor to have exposure to the price of gold without needing to deal with storage and other associated fees. Investors can sell their shares to other investors or back to the ETF.

          <strong>4. Gold Certificates</strong>
          offered by banks, allocated certificates represent an ownership to an actual amount of gold without the owner needing to store or insure it. Unallocated certificates are a form of fractional reserve banking and do not assure an equal exchange in the event of many people exchanging at the same time (called a run).

          <strong>5. Gold Derivatives</strong>
          Derivatives are contracts that derive their value from the fluctuating price of gold and include forwards, options and futures. They are often used to hedge against loss by investing in a contrary position.

          <strong>6. Stock In Mining Companies</strong>
          Rather than invest in gold itself, an investor might buy shares of a publicly traded mining company. As the gold price rises, so does the profit of the mining company which equates to an increase in stock price.

          Because it is traded on a market and has a constantly changing price, Bitcoin has attracted investors and companies offering financial products similar to gold.

          <strong>1. Buying Bitcoins</strong>
          Bitcoin's price is volatile and in the last year has fluctuated up to $50 a day, making it a profitable investment. Tax wise it is treated similar to the stock market, with short term capital gains tax expected on withdrawals under a year. This becomes complicated when Bitcoin is also used as a currency for purchasing items.

          <strong>2. Bitcoin Etf (proposed)</strong>
          There have been several Bitcoin ETFs that have filed for SEC approval, all of which are pending. The ETF will allow people to invest in Bitcoin without needing to buy, store or safekeep it.

          <strong>3. Bitcoin Derivatives</strong>
          As with other commodities with fluctuating daily prices, companies are creating financial products like futures that get their value from price volatility.

          Counterfeit involves creating imitation currency that is not legal tender.

          <strong>Identity Theft</strong>
          Thieves use sensitive personally identifiable information of their victims (such as name, address, phone numbers and social security numbers) to open credit cards or access and drain current bank accounts.

          <strong>Ponzi Schemes</strong>
          Also known as pyramid schemes, these investments pay old investors returns with the money from new investors, rather than from actual profit. The largest Ponzi scheme ever executed was the Bernie Madoff scandal of 2008, with investors losing $40 billion in the 30 year long fraud.

          <strong>Internet Fraud</strong>
          Hackers running fake websites ask users for private information that allows them to access their bank accounts (called phishing).

          <strong>Fraudulent Company Accounting</strong>
          Dishonest companies change the numbers in their bookkeeping or set up shell companies (companies with no product, value, or profit) to filter money to falsely alter company profits. An example of this fraud is the Enron scandal of 2001.

          <strong>Investor Fraud</strong>
          Stock market brokers use several illegal techniques to time the market to their benefit. Front running is buying personal shares of a stock right before a large client purchase that positively affects the market price, then selling for a profit right after. Insider trading is using company information that is not accessible to all investors to buy or sell on the stock market at an opportune moment. Market manipulation involves ###

          <strong>Physical Theft</strong>

          <strong>Counterfeit</strong>
          Gold coins and bars and sold as solid gold can be a less valuable metal that is gold plated. These metals often weigh the same as gold and dupe those that do not get the proper metallurgic tests.

          <strong>Cash For Gold</strong>
          Because gold does not have a global ledger authenticating ownership, stolen property can be processed through these companies.

          <strong>High Yield Investment Programs (hyips)</strong>
          An investment guaranteeing large returns on the gold market, these are often times pyramid schemes (aka Ponzi schemes, where new investors pay the returns on older investors).

          <strong>Shares In Fraudulent Mining Companies</strong>
          These companies either do not hold the large gold reserve that they advertise or have the potential for finding new gold. An example of this was the 1997 Bre-X scandal.

          <strong>Digital Theft</strong>
          Taking control of a coin's private key allows a thief to spend or transfer Bitcoins that are not theirs.

          <strong>Ponzi Schemes</strong>
          Where there is market volatility and opportunity for investment, there is an environment for pyramid fraud. This is no different for Bitcoin. A recent example is Trendon Shavers' scheme where he promised very high rates of return for his Bitcoin investors, buying coins for them and paying older investor's returns through new investor's money. He promised 7% weekly interest.

          <strong>Hacking Coins</strong>
          Thieves stole 850,000 bitcoins through security glitches in the Mt. Gox exchange collapse in 2014. 200,000 coins have been recovered since.

          <strong>Hacking Cpu Power</strong>
          Because mining Bitcoins requires a great deal of computing power and electricity, hackers have found a way to access cloud accounts (like Amazon Web Services) to use the servers for mining, running up hundreds of thousands of dollars of charges.

          <strong>Supply & Demand</strong>
          Exporting products and services creates demand for the US dollar because foreign customers need to pay with it. Foreign purchases of US stocks need to be bought in dollars as well.

          <strong>Psychology & Sentiment</strong>
          When consumers stop spending due to unemployment, the economy weakens and pessimism spreads to foreigners who sell their US-backed bonds and stocks back to their local currency.

          <strong>Economic Measurements</strong>
          The Federal Reserve publishes and uses its various reports to direct monetary policy, including financial statements of US banks' assets and liabilities, reports on US employment & consumer finances and industrial production among others.

          <strong>Supply & Demand</strong>
          Gold is traded on a market that is influenced by trading volume and supply vs demand, including the demand for derivatives.

          <strong>Commodity Value</strong>
          Gold's use in products like jewelry and technology make it reactive to consumer demand, which is influenced by economic factors like employment.

          <strong>Adoption By Businesses</strong>
          Bitcoin's acceptance by businesses creates sentiment that the money has strengthening value.

          <strong>Supply & Demand</strong>
          The price of Bitcoin is influenced by market fluctuations which are caused by exchange activity. Using Bitcoin as an investment (holding and exchanging coins in large quantities when a profit is made) increases price volatility. Using Bitcoin as a currency promotes stability as it ensures a consistent small scale flow of money.

          <strong>Psychology & Sentiment</strong>
          A main cause of value for any currency is the collective agreement that it has worth. A high Bitcoin price gives the impression of stability and worth while a period of loss gives the opposite impression.

          <strong>The Dollar Is A Hard Currency</strong>
          Hard currency (also called safe-haven or strong currency) is one that is used globally and seen as a stable source of value. The dollar has maintained its hard currency status for most of its history.

          The opposite are soft currencies which are unstable and experience frequent shifts in value.

          <strong>The Dollar Is The World's Top Reserve Currency</strong>
          The dollar makes up 66% of the world's central bank foreign currency reserves, which reinforces its strength.

          <strong>Is Regulated By A Governing Body</strong>
          Measures put in place stimulate consumer spending, which in turn strengthens the economy and dollar value.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <strong>Is Physical</strong>
          A government can't recklessly create new gold at will, which is a main cause of inflation.

          <strong>Is Driven By Global Market Forces</strong>
          Because no government agency is responsible for its value, it is not susceptible to perceived value loss due to political activities like war.

          <strong>Long Term Price Stability</strong>
          Gold has a history of maintaining its value over the long term.

          <strong>Useful For Risk Diversification In Investments</strong>
          People buy gold in addition to their other investments to vary their market exposure. In a period of slow economic growth, gold's value tends to rise.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <strong>Is An Accepted Currency</strong>
          There are currently over 700,000 retail establishments accepting Bitcoin, with the number growing each day. Public acceptance is a key factor in the value of a currency.

          <strong>Is Trust-less</strong>
          Bitcoin's blockchain open ledger is maintained by many independent individuals (miners) who work together to prevent fraud. Verified transactions are made public.

          <strong>Obscurs Identities</strong>
          Transactions are discrete and devoid of personally identifiable information (like name and address) and are instead logged by public keys, which are a string of letters and numbers. Public keys change per transaction.

          <strong>Is Decentralized</strong>
          Bitcoin is not run or managed by any one entity, financial corporation or government. This prevents interruptions with user transactions and fees by banks looking for more ways to increase their profits.

          <strong>Low Fees And Faster Transactions</strong>
          Wire transfer fees are eliminated (as an example, Wells Fargo charges $10 for transfers to non-Wells Fargo accounts with next day delivery, $22 per wire to foreign countries. $14.95 for same day non-Wells Fargo credit card payments. With Bitcoin the fees are between 4 and 7 cents per transaction to accounts anywhere on the globe. There is no fee to expedite transactions, which generally clear within 10 minutes.

          <strong>Is Internet-based</strong>
          Coins can be bought anywhere there is internet access. Purchasers do not need to visit a bank or any other specific site.

          <strong>Its Supply Is Truly Fixed</strong>
          Some investors see the finite quantities of a currency as a key to stabilizing the market factors of supply vs demand. Whereas newly found sources of gold could flood the supply, decreasing its value, the number of Bitcoins available to be mined is capped at 6 per hour, with the amount decreasing by 50% every 4 years.

          <strong>Could Help Stabilize Poor Economies</strong>
          Countries with unstable fiat currencies could use Bitcoin to hedge against the instability. In Argentina, savings accounts have been confiscated and taxed by the government. Lack of government regulation means this could not happen with a Bitcoin wallet without due cause. Bitcoin could also be an asset for very poor countries whose inhabitants are too impoverished to have bank accounts. These countries currently use SMS for currency, with associated companies taking cuts of up to 60% of the transaction price.

          <strong>Overconfidence</strong>
          The high global demand for the dollar has made interest rates low, which has allowed the government to run up a $12 trillion debt.

          <strong>Is Regulated By The Government </strong>
          This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Regulations (or lack thereof) can have a negative impact, such as what led to the 2008 mortgage crisis. Because monetary policy is decided by the Federal Reserve, who itself is comprised of private banks, it is likely that some of the policies are biased towards strengthening bank's profits.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <strong>Is Physical</strong>
          Because gold is physical it is inconvenient to store and protect from theft. Thieves counterfeit gold by using a less valuable yet same weight material as a base and gold plating it.

          <strong>Some Countries Have A Land Advantage</strong>
          Countries that have gold in their land have an advantage (Canada, the US, South Africa, China and Russia)

          <strong>Price Instability</strong>
          In the short term gold's price fluctuates based on day to day market activity

          <strong>Destabilizing</strong>
          A country backed by the gold standard has the possibility of becoming less stable through gold's market volatility
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <strong>Is Volatile</strong>
          The price of Bitcoin fluctuates by the minute, with exchanges never closing. In the month of December 2014 the price fluctuated between the price of $379 and $311 per coin, with a change of over $10 on some days.

          <strong>Bad Press</strong>
          Confidence in a currency's value is influenced by public perception. Bitcoin's early adoption by those dealing in illegal activities has given it a shady reputation.

          <strong>Will Likely Face Regulation</strong>
          Bitcoin's adoption could be perceived as a threat to a fiat currency and a government could thus restrict its use.

          <strong>Hacker Threat</strong>
          Because Bitcoin is completely digital, it could be compromised by hackers. Owners lost millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in the Mt. Gox exchange collapse, which was likely due to theft. A thief needs access to public and private keys in order to steal the currency.

          <strong>Chargebacks Are Impossible</strong>
          Because the blockchain is a permanent, irreversible ledger, it is not possible to reverse cleared transactions. Vendors would need to initiate a new transaction for issuing a refund.

          <strong>Long Term Economics Are Unknown</strong>
          Bitcoin and the blockchain are less than 10 years old and will possibly need refinements and adjustments. Some economists feel that in the long term Bitcoin's fixed quantity will cause a deflationary spiral (massive price increase due to fixed supply). Others feel that once all coins are mined transaction fees will increase and provide the impetus for individuals to maintain the blockchain.
