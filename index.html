          This type of money is useful in itself as well as as a currency. Gold is a material that used in many things from jewelry to technology. Market demand (if people are interested in buying and selling) drives its value.

          <h3>Other Examples</h3>
          silver, copper, salt, cigarettes, candy, barley

          <h3>Since 1785</h3>
          The original US financial system was constructed almost single-handedly by Alexander Hamilton and had bills called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_American_currency#Continental_currency">Continentals</a>. Continentals suffered a severe reduction in value during the Revolutionary War <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#United_States">due to over printing</a>.

          Congress issued the replacement currency, the dollar, on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_dollar#Background">August 8, 1785</a>. To ensure faith in its value, this new currency was backed by silver and gold- meaning that each dollar matched an existing quantity of either metal.

          This worked until there was a global devaluation of silver. In 1900 Congress passed the Gold Standard Act which tied the dollar only to gold.

          During World War I, US companies held debts to European companies and made payments with gold. This large liquidation disrupted the dollar exchange rate and led to the country temporarily suspending the gold standard.

          In 1971 the gold standard was <a href="http://www.federalreservehistory.org/Events/DetailView/33">permanently removed</a>.

          <h3>Since The Bronze Age</h3>
          The Bronze Age (3300-1200BC) marks man's first use of bronze and other metals <a href="http://www.ancient.eu/gold/">including gold</a>. Gold's beauty made it a valuable metal used in trading.

          Gold coins were first used in Persia in the <a href="http://taxfreegold.co.uk/goldcoinsbriefhistory.html">7th century B.C.</a>

          While today gold no longer backs any national currency, it remains a commodity traded on the market with a <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?From=XAU&To=USD">shifting price</a> due to market fluctuations. It tends to perform well <a href="http://www.moneycrashers.com/buying-gold-good-investment/">when confidence in a fiat currency drops</a>.

          <h3>Since 2008</h3>
          Digital currencies have been tried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_currencies#Non-cryptocurrencies">a few times</a> since the spread of the internet in the 1990s. Digicash, founded in 1989, eventually <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-215150.html">failed due to market forces favoring credit cards</a>.

          Bitcoin was invented in the wake of the 2008 US financial crisis by a person or group under the pseudonym <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>. It was introduced as open source software in 2009 and was the first fully implemented cryptocurrency. It's decentralized nature make it possible to conduct financial transactions with no middleman, and no banks (which, at the time, were being <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/">bailed out by the Government</a>).

          Since early 2013, transaction volume in Bitcoin has been <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/charts">steadily growing</a>, with mainstream businesses and websites (including <a href="http://www.overstock.com/bitcoin">Overstock.com</a>, <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/expedia-exec-bitcoin-payments-have-exceeded-estimates/"≥Expedia</a>, <a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/campaigns/bitcoin-marketing">Dell</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/17/okcupid-bitcoin/">OKCupid</a>) accepting it as payment.

          <h3>The Dollar Is A Hard Currency</h3>
          Hard currency (also called safe-haven or strong currency) is one that is used globally and seen as a stable source of value.

          <h3>The Dollar Is The World's Top Reserve Currency</h3>
          The dollar makes up 66% of the world's central bank foreign currency reserves, which reinforces its strength.

          <h3>Is Regulated By A Governing Body</h3>
          One of the Fed's statutory objectives is to implement policies that keep the dollar stable.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <div class="image"><span>Gold</span><img src="/images/advantages/gold.png"></div>
          <h3>Is Global</h3>
          Gold is highly liquid and can be easily converted to most fiat currencies. Because no government controls it, the price is set based on global markets.

          <h3>Long Term Price Stability</h3>
          Gold has a history of maintaining its value over the long term.

          <h3>Useful For Risk Diversification In Investments</h3>
          People buy gold in addition to their other investments to vary their market exposure. In a period of slow economic growth, gold's value tends to rise.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <div class="image"><span>Bitcoin</span><img src="/images/advantages/bitcoin.png"></div>
          <h3>Is Decentralized and Trust-less</h3>
          Because the computational power needed to secure the system is aggregated from independent miners, there is no need for the infrastructure of a single company or other body to maintain it. This is why Bitcoin is described as a "decentralized" currency. That you don't have to trust any one person/miner/computer in the network means that it is "trust-less".

          <h3>Is Secure</h3>
          The computational power required to verify transactions avoids the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending">Double Spend</a> attack, and the fact that all transactions need to agreed upon avoids the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/oldSiteFiles/byzantine.html">Byzantine Generals'</a> attacks.

          <h3>Low Fees And Fast Transactions</h3>
          The average transaction fee is .0001 Bticoins, or about 3¢, to send money to anyone, anywhere. Transactions take about 10 minutes to be verified by the network.

          <h3>Is Private</h3>
          Even though all transactions are public, the only identifiable information attached to each transaction is the sender and receivers' wallet address, which is not tied to any private personal data.

          <h3>Is Gaining Acceptance</h3>
          There are currently over 700,000 retail establishments accepting Bitcoin, with the number growing each day. Public acceptance is a key factor in the value of a currency.

          <h3>Is Regulated By The Government</h3>
          This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The Fed sets monetary policy, that while a boon when effective, can also allow for toxic environments like the 2008 mortgage crisis.

          <h3>Slow Electronic Transfers and Inconsistent Networks</h3>
          Many banks have a way to send money to other people that use the same bank quickly, and PayPal works well, but often charges a fee. Otherwise, an ACH transfer takes at least 1-2 days, and often longer.

          <h3>Counterfeiting</h3>
          Being such a popular currency means the Dollar is heavily counterfeited. It is estimated that about <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp154.aspx">1 in 10,000</a> notes are counterfeit.

          <div class="image"><span>Gold</span><img src="/images/disadvantages/gold.png"></div>
          <h3>Is Physical</h3>
          Because gold is physical it is inconvenient to store and protect from theft, and often that is only reliably done at a substantial cost- on average about <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/consumer-spending/2012-05-30/the-real-cost-of-owning-gold.html#slide4">.5 to 1 percent</a> of the gold's value per year.

          <h3>Counterfeiting</h3>
          Thieves counterfeit gold by using a less valuable yet same weight material as a base and gold plating it.

          <h3>Some Countries Have A Land Advantage</h3>
          Countries that have gold in their land have an advantage (Canada, the US, South Africa, China and Russia)

          <h3>Price Instability</h3>
          In the short term gold's price fluctuates based on day to day market activity
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <div class="image"><span>Bitcoin</span><img src="/images/disadvantages/bitcoin.png"></div>
          <h3>Is Volatile</h3>
          The price of Bitcoin fluctuates by the second, with exchanges never closing. In the month of December 2014 the price fluctuated from $379 to $311 per coin, with a change of over $10 on some days.

          <h3>Cost of Mining</h3>
          The cost includes price of equipment and electricity to keep the equipment running. Miners are attracted to places where electricity is less expensive. The current cost to mine Is $597.23 per coin (June 2014).

          <h3>Is Currently Being Regulated As A Commodity</h3>
          The current regulations treat Bitcoin as a commodity, not a currency, which makes owning and using it for daily transactions more complicated.

          <h3>Chargebacks Are Impossible</h3>
          All Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, making chargebacks impossible. Whether this is a plus or a minus depends on your perspective.

          <h3>Long-Term Economics Are Unknown</h3>
          Bitcoin is only 6 years old, and while modeled on gold, it is still a new form of currency. Some economists feel that in the long term Bitcoin's fixed quantity will cause a deflationary spiral (massive price increase due to fixed supply).

          Once all Bitcoins are mined, the only incentive to verify transactions will be transaction fees. These fees will rise over time as the coinbase payout decreases, though it is unknown by how much they will rise.

          Dollars are essentially <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/why-debt-and-money-created-out/">created through debt</a>. This is done a number of ways...

          <h3>The US Treasury borrows money from The Federal Reserve</h3>
          When The Fed buys bonds (IOUs) from the Treasury, the Treasury <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_currency_orders.htm">prints and mints</a> the bond's value in new currency. The bonds lent by The Fed are known as Federal Reserves. The Fed also pays for the cost of printing bills (about 4¢ per note) and minting coins (face value of the coin).

          <h3>Commercial Banks Get Dollars From A Federal Reserve Bank In Their District</h3>
          The banks pay the value of the money by drawing down their reserve accounts with their district Fed Bank.

          <h3>Old Notes and Coins are Destroyed</h3>
          Notes in poor condition are collected and shredded (about 7,000 tons per year). 90% of the notes delivered are used to replace older notes. $470 billion notes are created per year, 14-20 billion coins.

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <div class="image"><span>Gold</span><img src="/images/produces/gold.png"></div>
          <h3>Placer Mining</h3>
          Placer mining is used where gold has accumulated in the earth in ancient stream beds. Miners can find the ore by hand by panning or by machine by sluicing and dredging. The gold is then extracted through gravity separation.

          <h3>Extracted From Ore</h3>
          Hard rock mining is used when gold is encased in rock. This is the method that produces the most gold and is done through open-pit mining (digging the earth in sections to form a large pit). The gold is extracted from the rocks through a chemical reaction with cyanide, a toxic compound. Earth is cut and crushed into a flour-like powder then chemically treated with cyanide which separates the metal from the remaining rock flour. Zinc is then added to separate the cyanide from remaining gold. Then the result is melted to further remove impurities. To achieve 99.5% purity or higher, the gold has further chemical and electrolytic processing.

          <h3>Recycling</h3>
          Gold is also recycled- all the gold mined throughout history is still in existence. A new gold ring might contain some gold that was mined by ancient Romans 2000 years ago.

          <h3>Wasted Gold</h3>
          Gold used in technologies like cell phones does not always get recycled, and is therefore essentially wasted when the technology is discarded.

          <h3><a href="http://www.bitcoinmining.com/">Mining</a></h3>
          When a miner is the frist to verify a new set of transactions, called a "block", that miner is <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#term-coinbase-tx">rewarded with new Bitcoins</a>. The <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins">total number</a> that will ever be mined is <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001802/ch01.html#_what_is_bitcoin">21 million</a>.

          <h3>Lost Bitcoins</h3>
          Because the public and private keys of a Bitcoin Wallet are needed to create a transaction, if those keys are lost the Bitcoin in that wallet is unusable and permanently out of circulation.

          <h3>Official Currency</h3>
          The US Dollar is the official currency of the USA and a few other countries. American businesses and households hold 15% of the currency. The other 85% is unknown but is likely held as offshore stockpiles and in international reserves. It is also a standard unit of currency for global commodities markets like gold and oil.

          <h3>Reserve Currency</h3>
          Countries who have unstable financial systems hold large quantities of US dollars for use in international transactions and to back their own financial system in the event of a crisis.

          The US dollar is the most used reserve currency. Others include the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen.

          <h3>Investment Vehicle, Reserve, And Possible Currency Backing.</h3>
          Gold is traded on the commodity market and is used as an investment.

          It can also be used as a currency backing, which is known as the gold standard. In this system, money is tied to a specific amount of gold and can be exchanged for it. While historically many countries, including the USA, were on the gold standard, currenty no country uses it.

          The US Treasury currently holds 261.5 million troy ounces of gold, valued at $434.6 billion.

          <h3>Jewelry</h3>
          Gold's natural beauty has made it widely used for a very long time. About 84,300 tonnes, or 50% of all gold, is used in jewelry.

          <h3>Technology</h3>
          About 12% of the world's current gold production goes towards technology, with 50¢ of gold being used within each cell phone, totaling $500 million worldwide.

          <h3>Alternate Currency</h3>
          Bitcoin is used as an alternate currency in the growing number of places that accept it.

          <h3>Transaction/Data Infrastructure</h3>
          There are many new companies using the Bitcoin infrastructure to facilitate secure transactions, contracts, ownership, and to send fiat currencies.

          <h3>Investment Vehicle</h3>
          Its inherent price volatility makes it attractive to market traders looking to profit off of its highs and lows.

          <h3>1. Bank Savings Account</h3>
          A savings account with a bank allows a customer to save money with interest returned. The interest is typically very low- under 1% but the money is insured by the FDIC and is available for immediate withdrawal.

          <h3>2. CDs (Certificate Of Deposit)</h3>
          Similar to a savings account, a CD is insured and has a fixed interest rate slightly higher than a savings account. They differ in that the money must stay in the account for a fixed amount of time.

          <h3>3. Money Market Accounts</h3>
          Similar to a savings account, but allows for the ability to withdraw from the account provided a minimum balance is met.

          <h3>4. Stock Market</h3>
          A place to buy and sell ownership shares of companies. Over the long run and across the entire market, return rates average 7% but are not guaranteed.

          <h3>5. Mutual Fund</h3>
          A professionally managed product that allows investment in a collection of stocks. Investors can take their money out of the mutual fund without needing to do it through an exchange.

          <h3>6. Index Fund</h3>
          An investment product that combines a similar group of stocks into one fund that is managed by a computer rather than by a person. The index model uses statistics to decide which stocks are included and are partitioned to a section of the market.

          <h3>7. ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)</h3>
          Traded on stock exchanges, ETFs are comprised of a collection of stocks, commodities or bonds that act similar to an index fund but require less selling of its components and therefore have lower fees.

          <h3>8. Hedge Funds</h3>
          Funds that are not available publicly that use risky short term investment methods to maximize profit for their investors. They are typically only used by high net worth individuals and are structured to avoid government regulation.

          <div class="image"><span>Gold</span><img src="/images/invest/gold.png"></div>
          People tend to invest in gold more during periods of economic weakness. Its day-to-day price volatility make it appealing to those wanting to profit off of its fluctuations.

          <h3>1. Bullion</h3>
          Bulk gold in the form of bars and coins. The word comes from the French word for 'boiling' (bouillon) which was the term for historic melting houses.

          <h3>2. Coins</h3>
          Similar to bullion bars, gold coins are a store of value and not meant for use as currency. Their small size makes them easier to store and distribute.

          <h3>3. Gold ETFs</h3>
          These funds are traded on the stock market like stock ETFs and allow an investor to have exposure to the price of gold without needing to deal with storage and other associated fees. Investors can sell their shares to other investors or back to the ETF.

          <h3>4. Gold Certificates</h3>
          Offered by banks, allocated certificates represent an ownership to an actual amount of gold without the owner needing to store or insure it. Unallocated certificates are a form of fractional reserve banking and do not assure an equal exchange in the event of many people exchanging at the same time (called a run).

          <h3>5. Gold Derivatives</h3>
          Derivatives are contracts that derive their value from the fluctuating price of gold and include forwards, options and futures. They are often used to hedge against loss by investing in a contrary position.

          <h3>6. Stock In Mining Companies</h3>
          Rather than invest in gold itself, an investor might buy shares of a publicly traded mining company. As the gold price rises, so does the profit of the mining company which equates to an increase in stock price.

          <div class="image"><span>Bitcoin</span><img src="/images/invest/bitcoin.png"></div>
          Because it is traded on a market and has a constantly changing price, Bitcoin has attracted investors and companies offering financial products similar to gold.

          <h3>1. Buying and Exchanging Bitcoins</h3>
          Bitcoin's price is volatile and in the last year has fluctuated up to $50 a day, making it a profitable investment. Tax wise it is treated similar to the stock market, with short term capital gains tax expected on withdrawals under a year.

          <h3>2. Bitcoin ETF (proposed)</h3>
          There have been several Bitcoin ETFs that have filed for SEC approval, all of which are pending. The ETF will allow people to invest in Bitcoin without needing to buy, store or safekeep it.

          <h3>3. Bitcoin Derivatives</h3>
          As with other commodities with fluctuating daily prices, companies are creating financial products like futures that get their value from price volatility.

          <h3>Supply & Demand</h3>
          Exporting products and services creates demand for the US dollar because foreign customers need to pay with it. Foreign purchases of US stocks need to be bought in dollars as well.

          <h3>Psychology & Sentiment</h3>
          When consumers stop spending due to unemployment, the economy weakens and pessimism spreads to foreigners who sell their US-backed bonds and stocks back to their local currency.

          <h3>Economic Measurements</h3>
          The Federal Reserve publishes and uses its various reports to direct monetary policy, including financial statements of US banks' assets and liabilities, reports on US employment & consumer finances and industrial production among others.

          <h3>Supply & Demand</h3>
          Gold is traded on a market that is influenced by trading volume and supply vs. demand, including the demand for derivatives.

          <h3>Psychology & Sentiment</h3>
          The price of gold often has an inverse correlation with the dollar and the stock market as a whole. When the economy is perceived to be weaker, gold is seen as a more reliable store of value.

          <h3>Commodity Value</h3>
          Gold's use in products like jewelry and technology make it reactive to consumer demand, which is influenced by larger economic factors like unemployment.

          <h3>Supply & Demand</h3>
          The price of Bitcoin is influenced by market fluctuations which are caused by exchange activity. Using Bitcoin as an investment (holding and exchanging coins in large quantities when a profit is made) increases price volatility. Using Bitcoin as a currency promotes stability as it ensures a consistent small scale flow of money.

          <h3>Psychology & Sentiment</h3>
          A main cause of value for any currency is the collective agreement that it has worth. A high Bitcoin price gives the impression of stability and worth while a period of loss gives the opposite impression.

          <h3>Adoption By Businesses</h3>
          Bitcoin being accepted by businesses for normal transactions helps move the perception of the currency closer to that of the dollar. Knowing that you can use it to buy lunch, a car, or pay your bills dramaticlly increases the perceived value of Bitcoin as a currency.

          All US Dollars are marked with serial numbers which allow for it to be tracked. Dollars arrive to commercial banks in sequential order.

          <h3>The LBMA (London Bullion Market Association)</h3>
          One of the costs associated with owning gold is verifying its authenticity through assaying (purity testing). One way to get around this fee is to obtain it from a system that has already verified its chain of custody.

          Physical gold that is bought and traded within the London Bullion Market is verified by its association, the LBMA, which verifies the gold from refiner to dealer to owner and stores gold in approved vaults. Gold stored at home or outside the chain must be re-assayed before it is let back into the system. This verification system allows for expedited transactions.

          <h3>Taxes</h3>
          The US Government charges taxes on earnings (to individuals and businesses) via the Internal Revenue Service. This includes earnings from normal pay, bank interest, stock market dividends, capital gains, and most other income.

          <h3>Bank Fees</h3>
          There are numerous fees charged by banks. Just a few examples:
          - Monthly/Annual Service Fee
          - Membership Fees
          - Minimum Balance Fee
          - Foreign Exchange Fees
          - Foreign Transaction Fee (in addition to the Foreign Exchange Fee)
          - Penalties on Overdrafts
          - Penalties for drawing too many times from a savings account
          - Lost debit/credit card Fees
          - Paper Statement Fees
          - ATM Fees
          - Human Teller Fee
          - Early Account Closure Fee
          - Returned Deposit Fee (someone writing you a bad check)

          <h3>Credit Card Fees</h3>
          Consumers pay interest on a carried balance, and fees for late payments. Some credit cards also change an annual membership fee.

          Vendors also pay a fee per transaction.
          - Square (Swiped: 2.75%, Manually entered: 3.50% plus $0.15, or Flat rate of $275 per month)
          - Paypal (Swiped: 2.70%, Manually entered: 3.50% plus $0.15)
          - Credit Card companies (2%)

          Vendors typically pass transaction costs to their customers by raising their prices.

          <div class="image"><span>Gold</span><img src="/images/fees/gold.png"></div>
          <h3>Fees For Physical Gold Dealer Markups, Transportation, Testing, Storage, Insurance, Processing</h3>
          - Paying a dealer premium (beyond cost of gold - usually 2-5%)
          - Shipping Fee (including insurance and armored vehicle if worth over $100k)
          - Assaying (testing for purity & appraising)
          - Vault Storage Fees (typically 0.5%-1% of the gold's value) per year & includes insurance
          - Insurance for gold kept in a safe deposit box
          - Safe for home storage
          - Insurance for home storage
          - Taxes on capital gains

          <h3>Fees For Gold ETFs</h3>
          An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment fund traded on the comodities market like stocks. Unlike physical gold, ETFs allow multiple investors to combine into a single fund.
          - Commissions on buying selling
          - Expense ratio (recurring annual fee to cover its management)

          <h3>Commission Fees</h3>
          Paid in USD or other fiat currency, commission fees are paid to exchanges when converting fiat money to Bitcoin. Coinbase charges 1% of the transaction.

          <h3>Bank Fees</h3>
          Paid in USD or other fiat currency, bank fees are paid to the bank transferring dollars to the Bitcoin exchange. The fee is usually 15¢.

          <h3>Miner Fees</h3>
          Miner fees are optional but are an incentive to speed up the transaction verification process (inclusion into the blockchain). People opting out of paying a miner fee will see their transaction clearing in a significantly longer time (in our test it took 12 hours with no fee vs 10 minutes with fee). Fees are based on the amount of bytes required by the transaction. More bytes equal more processing time for the miners. Fees are calculated accordingly:
          - 0.0001 Bitcoins (4¢) for first kilobyte
          - 0.0002 Bitcoins (8¢) after first kilobyte

          The fees are related to the technical transaction size, not the monetary size. The more the system must work to patch together parts of original bitcoins to create the total, the higher the bytes. A $250 transaction could have a lower fee than a $19.95 transaction.

          <h3>Fees Are Paid By The Spender, Not The Vendor</h3>
          Unlike in PayPal or credit card processing, the person buying pays the fees on the transaction. This makes it an attractive option for vendors.

          We randomly picked a <a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/bc507795e86f2be8ccfa605f2d944b6525f5ac5710f72b7c4700523c0be7290e">transaction</a> from blockchain.info totaling 0.34522894 Bitcoin ($123.19). The miner fee paid by the person buying was .0001 Bitcoin (4¢). The same transaction made through PayPal would cost the vendor $4.46.

          Another <a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/9eeebd86443b9316dfbf881103bdc8b7c8e045fdb5cf90a20e9e4788f620ba65">transaction</a> shows the same miner fee of .0001 Bitcoin (4¢) on a 37.9362385 Bitcoin purchase ($13,543.62). Made through PayPal that same transaction would cost the vendor $474.18.

          While the vendors do not pay a fee per transaction, they will pay a commission fee when they exchange their earned Bitcoins for dollars (1%).

          Financial markets have regulatory oversight from these two agencies which work to ensure proper information is given to investors and traders so they can make sound decisions and also work to prevent fraud.

          The SEC was created in 1934 and the CFTC in 1974. They are both comprised of a non-partisan group of 5 commissioners, with one selected by the president as chairman. The current SEC chairman is Mary Jo White and the current CFTC chairman is Timothy Massad.

          Neither the SEC or CFTC has complete authority over gold's markets as most brokerage firms are monitored by self-regulatory organizations that they join. Exchanges also have their own regulatory groups.

          <h3>The Bitcoin Software</h3>
          The Bitcoin software <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply">regulates the frequency in which new Bitcoins are created</a> and verifies all transactions in a decentralized way. This eliminates the need for one company or governing body to oversee the system. Changes to the system have to be approved by the majority of users before they are implemented.

          <h3>Central Banks and Goverments</h3>
          No one body runs or regulates Bitcoin within its own system. However as a result of its increased use, the US government is examining ways to prevent misuse and fraud. The GAO (Government Accountability Office) is an independent agency that was created in 1921. It is referred to as <a href="http://www.gao.gov/about/">"The Congressional Watchdog"</a> for its reports uncovering waste and inefficiency in government. It conducts financial audits and other investigative services.

          In 2013 the GAO <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/654620.pdf">called for increased oversight</a> for Bitcoin and recommended the IRS create tax guidance around virtual currencies. The result was the IRS declaring it to be <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Virtual-Currency-Guidance">treated as property</a>. Other regulations are still being formed.

          In July 2014 the European Banking Authority <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/eba-financial-institutions-avoid-bitcoin-pending-regulation/">advised European banks not to deal in virtual currencies</a> until a regulatory regime was in place.

          In April 2014 China Central Bank ordered commercial banks to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304157204579475233879506454">close Bitcoin trading accounts</a>. Trading Bitcoins by individuals <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-05/china-s-pboc-bans-financial-companies-from-bitcoin-transactions">remains legal</a>.

          <h3>Physical Theft</h3>

          <h3>Counterfeiting</h3>
          Counterfeiting involves creating imitation currency that is not legal tender.

          <h3>Identity Theft</h3>
          Thieves use sensitive personally identifiable information of their victims (such as name, address, phone numbers and social security numbers) to open credit cards or access and drain current bank accounts.

          <h3>Ponzi Schemes</h3>
          Also known as pyramid schemes, these investments pay old investors returns with the money from new investors, rather than from actual profit. The largest Ponzi scheme ever executed was the Bernie Madoff scandal of 2008, with investors losing $40 billion in the 30 year long fraud.

          <h3>Internet Fraud</h3>
          Hackers running fake websites ask users for private information that allows them to access their bank accounts (called phishing).

          <h3>Fraudulent Company Accounting</h3>
          Dishonest companies change the numbers in their bookkeeping or set up shell companies (companies with no product, value, or profit) to filter money to falsely alter company profits. An example of this fraud is the Enron scandal of 2001.

          <h3>Investor Fraud</h3>
          Stock market brokers use several illegal techniques to time the market to their benefit. Front running is buying personal shares of a stock right before a large client purchase that positively affects the market price, then selling for a profit right after. Insider trading is using company information that is not accessible to all investors to buy or sell on the stock market at an opportune moment.

          <h3>Physical Theft</h3>

          <h3>Counterfeiting</h3>
          Gold coins and bars and sold as solid gold can be a less valuable metal that is gold plated. These metals often weigh the same as gold and dupe those that do not get the proper metallurgic tests.

          <h3>Cash For Gold</h3>
          Because gold does not have a global ledger authenticating ownership, stolen property can be processed through these companies.

          <h3>High Yield Investment Programs (HYIPs)</h3>
          An investment guaranteeing large returns on the gold market, these are often times pyramid schemes (aka Ponzi schemes, where new investors pay the returns on older investors).

          <h3>Shares In Fraudulent Mining Companies</h3>
          These companies either do not hold the large gold reserve that they advertise or have the potential for finding new gold. An example of this was the 1997 Bre-X scandal.

          <h3>Digital Theft</h3>
          Taking control of a coin's private key allows a thief to spend or transfer Bitcoins that are not theirs.

          <h3><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending">Double Spend Attack</a></h3>
          This is when a fruadulent computer tries to send multiple transactions using the same money. Bitcoin's decentralized nature prevents this attack.

          <h3><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/oldSiteFiles/byzantine.html">Byzantine Generals' Problem</a></h3>
          This attack involves having multiple computers send and receive fraudulent data. The attacker would need to have 51% of the computers on the network disseminate fraudulent data for this to work, and Bitcoin's decnetralized network and cost of computing power to confirm transactions makes this effectively impossible.

          <h3>Ponzi Schemes</h3>
          Where there is market volatility and opportunity for investment, there is an environment for pyramid fraud. This is no different for Bitcoin. A recent example is Trendon Shavers' scheme where he promised very high rates of return for his Bitcoin investors, buying coins for them and paying older investor's returns through new investor's money. He promised 7% weekly interest.

          <h3>Hacking Coins</h3>
          Thieves stole 850,000 bitcoins through security glitches in the Mt. Gox exchange collapse in 2014. 200,000 coins have been recovered since.

          <h3>Hacking CPU Power</h3>
          Because mining Bitcoins requires a great deal of computing power and electricity, hackers have found a way to access cloud accounts (like Amazon Web Services) to use the servers for mining, running up hundreds of thousands of dollars of charges.
